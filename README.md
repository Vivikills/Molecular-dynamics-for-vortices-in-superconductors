Files represent a molecular dynamics project for vortices in a superconductor in Fortran. Sabroutine rand1.f90 generates random coordinates of vortices in the boundary region when they first enter the sample. Sabroutine processes1.f90 is responsible for the processes occurring in the system, such as the birth and destruction of vortexes, calculation of energies, etc. Sabroutine LJ_DE10.f90 is responsible for launching the entire algorithm, that is, for solving a system of differential equations using the Runge-Kutta method
